## Learning to code
- Explore what's happening in internal_ptr script with the templates and internal_ptr thing
- Empty namespaces name declaration & using namespaces vs include headers
- What are macros
- When are macros compiled
  - Why use macros?
  - methods cannot be called globally? why?

  - what is ui binding? - property change emit event listner
- typename... arg and &&...arg && std::forward(args)...
- std::apply
- NUMA architecture & SALSA
